#An Exploratory Data Analysis on Uber's Demand Profile
Uber kickstarted the evolution of the taxi market in the early 2010s, when it launched an app which easily connected drivers with riders. Uber Technologies, Inc. is now an American multinational transportation network company based in San Francisco and has operations in approximately 72 countries and 10,500 cities. 131 million people use Uber or Uber Eats once a month, an 11% increase year-on-year. It generated $31.8 billion revenue in 2022, an 82% increase on the previous year.

Ridesharing is a very volatile market and demand fluctuates wildly with time, place, weather, local events, etc. The key to being successful in this business is to be able to detect patterns in these fluctuations and cater to the demand at any given time.

Assuming that I am a newly hired Data Scientist in Uber's New York Office, I have been given the task of extracting insights from data that will help the business better understand the demand profile and take appropriate actions to drive better outcomes for the business. My goal is to identify good insights that are potentially actionable.
